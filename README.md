# MD.ai
A comprehensive sample code that can be referenced for use in MD.ai (https://md.ai/)
Refer the docs at MD.ai for code templates (https://docs.md.ai/)

A Chexnet model is implemented along with the code. Future implementations : arnoweng repo (https://github.com/arnoweng/CheXNet)

Code produces multiple bounding boxes using the Chexnet model in the MD.ai platform.
P.S: Use Local Labels option in MD.ai to enable bounding boxes. Feel free to contact me if you face issues.
Currently on the lookout for summer internships in the US (Summer 2023) for data science roles. Help in anyway works.

Just zip the model folder and upload to your md.ai project
